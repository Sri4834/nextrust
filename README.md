**YOU CAN ACCESS THIS WEBSITE HERE :-** https://v0-zero-trust-vault.vercel.app/

## Key Features

### 1. **Authentication System**
- User registration with role selection (Admin, Manager, Employee)
- Secure login with credential verification
- Support for both demo users and registered users
- Session management with IP tracking

### 2. **Real-Time IP Monitoring**
- Automatic IP address polling every 5 seconds
- VPN detection via IP change detection
- Automatic session termination on IP mismatch
- Trusted IP verification system

### 3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
Three user roles with distinct permissions:

- **Admin**: Full access to all system files and maximum privileges
- **Manager**: Access to team, project, and departmental files
- **Employee**: Access to handbook and technical documentation

### 4. **Secure File Management**
- 12+ professional sample files with category separation
- Dynamic file downloads with custom popup preview
- IP-based and role-based file access restrictions
- Restricted file visibility for unauthorized roles (visible but locked)

### 5. **Security Features**
- Real-time security event logging
- Suspicious IP detection with instant alerts
- Auto-logout on security threats
- Custom popup alert system for all notifications
- Session tracking and activity monitoring

### 6. **Professional UI**
- Modern glassmorphism design with backdrop filters
- Responsive layout for all devices
- Beautiful custom popup alerts
- Color-coded status indicators
- Intuitive sidebar navigation

## Zero Trust Principles Implemented

### 1. **Verify Every Access**
Every user and device is verified before accessing resources, regardless of network location or previous access history.

### 2. **IP Monitoring**
Real-time IP address tracking and validation. Detect unauthorized access attempts or VPN usage instantly with 5-second polling intervals.

### 3. **Role-Based Access**
Granular access control with three role levels. Each role has specific file permissions with least privilege enforcement.

### 4. **Assume Breach**
Automatic logout and session termination on IP anomalies. The system assumes every connection might be compromised.

### 5. **Real-Time Logging**
Comprehensive security event logging. Track all access attempts, file downloads, and suspicious activities in the dashboard.

### 6. **Least Privilege**
Users only get access to resources they need. Restricted files are visible but locked for unauthorized roles preventing unauthorized downloads.

## User Credentials

### Demo Users (Pre-registered)
\`\`\`
Admin Account:
- Username: admin
- Password: admin123
- Role: Admin

Manager Account:
- Username: manager
- Password: manager123
- Role: Manager

Employee Account:
- Username: employee
- Password: emp123
- Role: Employee
\`\`\`

### Sample Registered User
After signing up, users can create custom accounts with any username, email, and role selection.

## How to Use

### 1. **Getting Started**
- Open `landing.html` to see the platform overview
- Click "Sign Up" to create a new account or use demo credentials
- Select your role during registration

### 2. **Login Process**
1. Enter username and password
2. Select your role from dropdown
3. System fetches your current IP
4. IP is stored as "trusted IP" for this session
5. Redirects to dashboard

### 3. **Dashboard Navigation**
- **Overview**: Session info and IP status
- **Files**: Browse and download files based on role
- **Security**: View security logs and activity

### 4. **File Access**
- **Public Files**: Accessible to all roles
- **Restricted Files**: 
  - Admin: Full access to all files
  - Manager: Access to team and project files
  - Employee: Limited access (can see but cannot download restricted files)

### 5. **VPN/IP Change Detection**
- System monitors IP every 5 seconds
- When VPN is enabled (IP changes):
  - "Suspicious IP detected" alert appears
  - User is automatically logged out after 3 seconds
  - Session is cleared and redirected to login

## Security Features Explained

### IP Monitoring
- **Initial Login**: System captures your current IP as "trusted IP"
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Every 5 seconds, system checks if your IP matches
- **VPN Detection**: When VPN is enabled, IP changes and triggers security alert
- **Auto-Logout**: Prevents unauthorized access from different locations

### Role-Based Permissions

**Admin Files (9 files)**
- System Administration Guide
- Server Infrastructure Report
- Financial Report Q4 2024
- Employee Handbook
- Strategic Plan 2025
- Operations Manual
- Technical Documentation
- Client Contract
- Security Audit

**Manager Files (4 files)**
- Team Performance Report
- Project Management Guide
- Departmental Guidelines
- Operations Manual

**Employee Files (3 files)**

### Restricted File Access
- Employees can **see** all restricted files in the dashboard
- When clicking download on restricted files, a popup appears:
  - "Access Denied - Insufficient Privileges"
  - Users are informed of their access limitations

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture
- **HTML**: Semantic structure with proper form handling
- **CSS**: Advanced styling with glassmorphism, gradients, and animations
- **JavaScript**: Event-driven architecture with real-time monitoring

### Data Storage
- **Session Storage**: Temporary user session data and IP tracking
- **Local Storage**: User registration data persistence
- **Browser Storage**: File metadata and access logs

### Security Measures
- Client-side validation of credentials
